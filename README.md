## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test (component.spec.ts)` to execute the unit tests via jest.

Here is the docker link for the image:

TODO: 
1- Setup cypress and add E2E testing.
2- Create virtual scrolling.
3- Create a list of checkboxes containers all the parameters of the api response and the user will be able to choose the columns he need to filter that.
after that I will take these parameters as a query parameters with the api call to get only the selected columns. (to change the current implementation from static with adding random columns to dynamic columns).
